@package hasql-effectful
@version 0.1.0.0


-- | Contains the statically dispatched effect, and relevant functions for
--   a pool of connections DB effect. If you only need to handle a single
--   connection, you could look into <tt>hasql-effectful</tt> instead.
--   
--   This adapts the <tt>hasql-pool</tt> package.
module Effectful.Hasql.Pool

-- | Connection pool DB effect
data DB :: Effect

-- | Use a connection from the pool to run a DB session, and returns it to
--   the pool when finished.
use :: forall (es :: [Effect]) (a :: Type). DB :> es => Session a -> Eff es (Either UsageError a)

-- | Run a <tt>DB</tt> effect with the initial representation/environment:
--   a DB pool.
runDB :: forall (es :: [Effect]) (a :: Type). IOE :> es => Pool -> Eff (DB : es) a -> Eff es a
